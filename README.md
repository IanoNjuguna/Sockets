# Sockets

This repository contains C programs for building both HTTP and TCP servers. These servers handle client requests, demonstrate basic networking concepts, and serve as educational resources for understanding socket programming in C.

## Description

This repository contains four directories. The contents of these directories include:

### HTTP Server & HTTP Client:

- A basic HTTP server that listens for incoming HTTP requests on a specified port.
- Supports handling GET and POST requests.
- Parses HTTP requests to extract headers, URL, and body data.

### TCP Server & TCP Client:

- A basic TCP server that listens for incoming TCP connections on a specified port.
- Establishes connections with clients and handles data transmission.
- Supports basic error handling and graceful termination.
